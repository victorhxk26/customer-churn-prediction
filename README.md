# Customer Churn Prediction in the Banking Industry Using Machine Learning Approaches
Customer churn is one of the main persistent problems every service provider in the banking industry needs to address as this will result in significant financial loss and a drop in brand reputation for the company if left unattended. This prompts the need for the prediction of bank customer churn prediction. Therefore, this project aims to use machine learning approaches for customer churn prediction tasks using R. The dataset used in this project revolves around customer data for a multinational bank in Europe. Data preprocessing techniques such as the creation of missing values and imputing them with median and mode as well as performing one hot encoding. Three baseline models are implemented using logistic regression, support vector regression and random forest followed by hyperparameter tuning on each model using techniques like L1 regularisation for logistic regression and grid search for support vector machine and random forest. As a result, random forest-based models, both baseline and tuned, produced the best performance across all models in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score and AUC value.


**P.S.** The Python version of the development and deployment of the bank customer churn prediction model will be coming up soon! Stay tuned!
